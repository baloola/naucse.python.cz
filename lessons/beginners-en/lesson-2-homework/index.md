Try out these exercises at home. These are just examples. Try to find some more examples in the internet or just play around!

- Which Python version are you using?
- What is the type of an error that occurs when:
  - You are quoring only one side of a string? (*SyntaxError*)
  - You are trying to subtract a number from a string?
  - You divide by zero?
  - You try to use a variable that does not exist?
  - You press Ctrl+C when a program asks for input (using the `input` function)?
  - You put a space or tab before a statement?
  - You do not close parenthesis?
  - You are trying to use an exclamation mark as an operator
- What error occurs when you're trying to assign a string to a string?
- Not everything can be used as a variable name. Try the following, which ones can not be used as variable names? Why?
  - `x`,
  - `button4`,
  - `34`,
  - `3e4`,
  - `turkey`,
  - `$i`,
  - `square-root`,
  - `readme`,
  - `readme.txt`,
  - `shorterEdge`,
  - `shorter_edge`,
  - `NUMBER_OF_POINTS`,
  - `_`,
  - `Ï€`,
  - `True`,
  - `_cache`,
  - `__name__`,
  - `while`.
- Some of the names above are valid, but not very good variable names. Which ones do you think are those?
- Which one of `shorterEdge`, `shorter_edge` is a more correct name for a variable? Why? Try searching for *PEP 8 variable names*. What's a PEP 8?
- Try to write a program that calculates the surface and volume of a cube with edge = 2852 cm.
- Now change the program so that the user can enter the edge value.
