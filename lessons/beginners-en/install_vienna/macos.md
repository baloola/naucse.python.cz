# Python install for macOS

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) which makes app and modules installtation
much easier,


Enter this command in the command line/terminal:

```console
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

And then you can just enter this command:

```console
$ brew install python3
```
