# Python installation

We will do two things in this section:

* We will install Python
* We will give Python a test run.

You might ask why we need all this.

Python is programming language (a way how to tell computers what to do), 
and also a program we need so we can talk to our computer in Python language.

Choose a page depending on your operating system:

* [Linux]({{ subpage_url('linux') }})
* [Windows]({{ subpage_url('windows') }})
* [macOS]({{ subpage_url('macos') }})


If you have another system or if you have any problem send us an e-mail.
