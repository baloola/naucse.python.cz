# Python installation

We will do two things in this section:

* We will install Python and Conda
* We will create virtual environment
* We will give Python a test run.

You might ask why we need all this.

Python is programming language (a way how to tell computers what to do), 
and also a program we need so we can talk to our computer in Python language.

A virtual environment is something that will ensure that all computers
will behave similarly.
After we will activate it, we won't need special materials for Linux,
Windows and Macs.


> [note]
> In the future, we will use another advantage of virtual environments: 
> every venv is separated from each other, so if we install a 
> module (an extension for Python) it will be in just that environment
> where we want to have it. If that library breaks something in your 
> project, all other projects will be safe. 

Choose a page depending on your operating system:

* [Linux]({{ subpage_url('linux') }})
* [Windows]({{ subpage_url('windows') }})
* [macOS]({{ subpage_url('macos') }})


If you have another system or if you have any problem, don't hesitate
to ask your coach (raise the red post-it note), or send us an e-mail.
