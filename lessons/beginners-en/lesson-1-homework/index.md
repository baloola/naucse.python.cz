Try out these exercises at home. These are just examples. Try to find some more examples in the internet or just play around!

- Try to start up `python` and see if this still works:
```pycon
>>> 1+1
2
```
- How about other operations? Do you remember what `*` and `/` are doing? What about `%` and `**`? If you don't remember try figuring it out from the Python console. Try, e.g. `1%4`, `2%4`, `3%4`, `4%4`, `5%4`... or `2**1`, `2**2`, `2**3`, `2**4`, `2**5`... Can you explain the patterns?

- In Python you can add also strings of characters. E.g. `'A' + 'B'` would produce `'AB'`. What's wrong with the result of the following?
```pycon
>>> 'Hello' + 'World!'
```

- Try adding a number to a string. What happens? What is Python trying to tell you? What if you try to add a string to a number? 

- How about multiplying a string by a number? Can this work? `'Ha' * 10`
